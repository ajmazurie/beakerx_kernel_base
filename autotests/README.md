## Dependencies

Running the e2e tests from its GitHub source code requires: 
* chrome browser (80 or higher) 
* [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
* java (1.8 or higher)
* any beakerx kernel

## Run the tests

To run tests use `run_tests.py` with options:
```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --app APP   define target application 'notebook' or 'lab'
  --env ENV   define target conda environment where is jupyter notebook or lab
  --tst TST   define tests we need to run; for example: groovy.*
```
If we run `run_tests.py` script without any arguments it'll use default values as there:
```
./run_tests.py --env=beakerx --app=notebook --tst=groovy.*
```

By default, a notebook server runs locally at 127.0.0.1:8888 and is accessible only from localhost.
